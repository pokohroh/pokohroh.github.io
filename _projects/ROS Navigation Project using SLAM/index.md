title: ROS Navigation Project using SLAM
description: As part of a Systems Engineering Project 1, I have worked with a team on developing an autonomous navigation robotic system using Agilex LIMO robot, which simulates autonomous navigation around Changi Airport. 
In order to do so, we have created a miniture version of Changi Airport where our robot will be tested on.
Using Robotic Operating System, we were able to program Agilex LIMO robot. Through RTAB-Map SLAM approach, the robot was able to map the environment and localize itself simultaneously real time. 
Waypoints for navigation were identified directly through the RTAB-Map interface, allowing us to set specific goal locations within the mapped environment,
while the move_base navigation stack handled global and local path planning to avoid obstacles and determine the most efficient route.
My contribution in building the miniature version of Changi Airport, writing Python script that enabled the robot to follow the waypoints and adjusting parameters of the move_base navigation stack gave me hands-on experience in integration of SLAM to real-world robot hardware.
